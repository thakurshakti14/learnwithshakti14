<h3>C++ Multiple, Multilevel and Hierarchical Inheritance</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about different models of inheritance in C++ programming: Multiple, Multilevel and Hierarchical inheritance with examples.<br>

Inheritance is one of the core feature of an object-oriented programming language. It allows software developers to derive a new class from the existing class. The derived class inherits<br>
 the features of the base class (existing class).<br>

There are various models of inheritance in C++ programming.<br><br>

<h3>C++ Multilevel Inheritance</h3>
<li>In C++ programming, not only you can derive a class from the base class but you can also derive a class from the derived class. This form of inheritance is known as multilevel inheritance.<br>

<b>class A { <br>
... .. ... <br>
};<br>
class B: public A {<br>
... .. ...<br>
};<br>
class C: public B {<br>
... ... ...<br>
};<br></b>
Here, class B is derived from the base class A and the class C is derived from the derived class B.<br>
<h3>C++ Multiple Inheritance</h3>
In C++ programming, a class can be derived from more than one parent. For example, A class Bat is derived from base classes Mammal and WingedAnimal. It makes sense because <br>
bat is a mammal as well as a winged animal.<br>

Multiple Inheritance<br>
<h3>Ambiguity in Multiple Inheritance</h3>
The most obvious problem with multiple inheritance occurs during function overriding.<br>

Suppose, two base classes have a same function which is not overridden in derived class.<br>

If you try to call the function using the object of the derived class, compiler shows error. It's because compiler doesn't know which function to call. For example,<br>

<b>class base1 {<br>
  public:<br>
      void someFunction( ) {....}  <br>
};<br>
class base2 {<br>
    void someFunction( ) {....} <br>
};<br>
class derived : public base1, public base2 {};<br>

int main() {<br>
    derived obj;<br>
    obj.someFunction() // Error!  <br>
}<br></b>
This problem can be solved using the scope resolution function to specify which function to class either base1or base2<br>

<b>int main() {<br>
    obj.base1::someFunction( );  // Function of base1 class is called<br>
    obj.base2::someFunction();   // Function of base2 class is called.<br>
}<br></b>
<h3>C++ Hierarchical Inheritance</h3>
If more than one class is inherited from the base class, it's known as hierarchical inheritance. In hierarchical inheritance, all features that are common in child classes are included <br>
in the base class.<br>

For example, Physics, Chemistry, Biology are derived from Science class. Similarly, Dog, Cat, Horse are derived from Animal class.<br>

<li>Syntax of Hierarchical Inheritance<br>
<b>class base_class {<br>
     ... .. ...<br>
}<br>

class first_derived_class: public base_class {<br>
     ... .. ...<br>
}<br>

class second_derived_class: public base_class {<br>
     ... .. ...<br>
}<br>

class third_derived_class: public base_class {<br>
     ... .. ...<br>
}<br></b>
