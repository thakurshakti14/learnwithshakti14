<h3>C++ for Loop</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about the C++ for loop and its working .<br>

In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.<br>

For example, let's say we want to show a message 100 times. Then instead of writing the print statement 100 times, we can use a loop.<br>

That was just a simple example; we can achieve much more efficiency and sophistication in our programs by making effective use of loops.<br>

<b>There are 3 types of loops in C++.<br>

<li>for loop<br>
<li>while loop<br>
<li>do...while loop<br>
This tutorial focuses on C++ for loop. We will learn about the other type of loops in the upcoming tutorials.</b><br>

<h3>C++ for loop</h3>
<b>The syntax of for-loop is:<br>

for (initialization; condition; update) {<br>
    // body of-loop <br>
}<br></b>
Here,<br>

initialization - initializes variables and is executed only once<br>
condition - if true, the body of for loop is executed<br>
if false, the for loop is terminated<br>

<h3>Example 1: Printing Numbers From 1 to 5</3>
<b>#include <iostream><br>

using namespace std;<br>

int main() {<br>
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {<br>
        cout << i << " ";<br>
    }<br>
    return 0;<br>
}<br>
Output<br>

1 2 3 4 5<br>
Here is how this program works<br>

Iteration	Variable	i <= 5	Action<br>
1st	i = 1	true	1 is printed. i is increased to 2.<br>
2nd	i = 2	true	2 is printed. i is increased to 3.<br>
3rd	i = 3	true	3 is printed. i is increased to 4.<br>
4th	i = 4	true	4 is printed. i is increased to 5.<br>
5th	i = 5	true	5 is printed. i is increased to 6.<br>
6th	i = 6	false	The loop is terminated<br>


Iteration	Variable	i <= 5	Action<br>
1st	i = 1	true	Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 2.<br>
2nd	i = 2	true	Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 3.<br>
3rd	i = 3	true	Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 4.<br>
4th	i = 4	true	Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 5.<br>
5th	i = 5	true	Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 6.<br>
6th	i = 6	false	The loop is terminated<br></b>


Note that we have used a for loop.<br>

<li>for(int i = 1; i <= num; ++i)<br>
Here,<br>

<b>int i = 1: initializes the i variable<br>
i <= num: runs the loop as long as i is less than or equal to num<br>
++i: increases the i variable by 1 in each iteration<br>
When i becomes 11, the condition is false and sum will be equal to 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 10.<br></b>

<h3>Ranged Based for Loop</h3>
In C++11, a new range-based for loop was introduced to work with collections such as arrays and vectors. Its syntax is:<br>

<b>for (variable : collection) {<br>
    // body of loop<br>
}<br>
Here, for every value in the collection, the for loop is executed and the value is assigned to the variable.<br></b>

<h3>Example 4: Range Based for Loop</h3>
<b>#include <iostream><br>

using namespace std;<br>

int main() {<br>
  
    int num_array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};<br>
  
    for (int n : num_array) {<br>
        cout << n << " ";<br>
    }<br>
  
    return 0;<br>
}<br>
Output<br>

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br></b>
<li>In the above program, we have declared and initialized an int array named num_array. It has 10 items.<br>

Here, we have used a range-based for loop to access all the items in the array.<br>

<h3>C++ Infinite for loop</h3>
If the condition in a for loop is always true, it runs forever (until memory is full). For example,<br>

// infinite for loop<br>
for(int i = 1; i > 0; i++) {<br>
    // block of code<br>
}<br>
In the above program, the condition is always true which will then run the code for infinite times.<br>
