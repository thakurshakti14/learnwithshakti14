<h3>C++ Multidimensional Arrays</h3>
In this tutorial, we'll learn about multi-dimensional arrays in C++. More specifically, how to declare them, access them, and use them efficiently in our program.<br>

In C++, we can create an array of an array, known as a multidimensional array. For example:<br>

<b>int x[3][4];<br></b>
Here, x is a two-dimensional array. It can hold a maximum of 12 elements.<br>
We can think of this array as a table with 3 rows and each row has 4 columns as shown below.<br>

<b>Three-dimensional arrays also work in a similar way. For example:<br>

float x[2][4][3];<br>
This array x can hold a maximum of 24 elements.<br>

We can find out the total number of elements in the array simply by multiplying its dimensions:<br>

2 x 4 x 3 = 24<br></b>
<h3>Multidimensional Array Initialization</h3>
Like a normal array, we can initialize a multidimensional array in more than one way.<br>

<b>1. Initialization of two-dimensional array<br>
int test[2][3] = {2, 4, 5, 9, 0, 19};<br></b>
The above method is not preferred. A better way to initialize this array with the same array elements is given below:<br>

<b>int  test[2][3] = { {2, 4, 5}, {9, 0, 19}};<br>
This array has 2 rows and 3 columns, which is why we have two rows of elements with 3 elements each.<br></b>

<h3>2. Initialization of three-dimensional array</h3>
<b>int test[2][3][4] = {3, 4, 2, 3, 0, -3, 9, 11, 23, 12, 23, <br>
                 2, 13, 4, 56, 3, 5, 9, 3, 5, 5, 1, 4, 9};<br></b>
This is not a good way of initializing a three-dimensional array. A better way to initialize this array is:<br>

<b>int test[2][3][4] = { <br>
                     { {3, 4, 2, 3}, {0, -3, 9, 11}, {23, 12, 23, 2} },<br>
                     { {13, 4, 56, 3}, {5, 9, 3, 5}, {5, 1, 4, 9} }<br>
                 };<br></b>
Notice the dimensions of this three-dimensional array.<br>

The first dimension has the value 2. So, the two elements comprising the first dimension are:<br>

<li>Element 1 = { {3, 4, 2, 3}, {0, -3, 9, 11}, {23, 12, 23, 2} }<br>
<li>Element 2 = { {13, 4, 56, 3}, {5, 9, 3, 5}, {5, 1, 4, 9} }<br>
The second dimension has the value 3. Notice that each of the elements of the first dimension has three elements each:<br>

<li>{3, 4, 2, 3}, {0, -3, 9, 11} and {23, 12, 23, 2} for Element 1.<br>
<li>{13, 4, 56, 3}, {5, 9, 3, 5} and {5, 1, 4, 9} for Element 2.<br>
Finally, there are four int numbers inside each of the elements of the second dimension:<br>

<b>{3, 4, 2, 3}<br>
{0, -3, 9, 11}<br>
