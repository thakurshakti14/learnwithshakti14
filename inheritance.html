<h3>C++ Inheritance</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about inheritance in C++ with the help of examples.<br>

Inheritance is one of the key features of Object-oriented programming in C++. It allows us to create a new class (derived class) from an existing class (base class).<br>

The derived class inherits the features from the base class and can have additional features of its own. For example,<br>

<b>class Animal {<br>
    // eat() function<br>
    // sleep() function<br>
};<br>

class Dog : public Animal {<br>
    // bark() function<br>
};<br></b>
Here, the Dog class is derived from the Animal class. Since Dog is derived from Animal, members of Animal are accessible to Dog.<br>

Notice the use of the keyword public while inheriting Dog from Animal.<br>

<b>class Dog : public Animal {...};<br></b>
We can also use the keywords private and protected instead of public. We will learn about the differences between using private, public and protected later in this tutorial.<br>
<h3>is-a relationship</h3>
Inheritance is an is-a relationship. We use inheritance only if an is-a relationship is present between the two classes.<br>

Here are some examples:<br>

<li>A car is a vehicle.<br>
<li>Orange is a fruit.<br>
<li>A surgeon is a doctor.<br>
<li>A dog is an animal.<br>
<h3>C++ protected Members</h3>
The access modifier protected is especially relevant when it comes to C++ inheritance.<br>

Like private members, protected members are inaccessible outside of the class. However, they can be accessed by derived classes and friend classes/functions.<br>

We need protected members if we want to hide the data of a class, but still want that data to be inherited by its derived classes.<br>
To learn more about protected, refer to our C++ Access Modifiers tutorial.<br>
<h3>Access Modes in C++ Inheritance</h3>
In our previous tutorials, we have learned about C++ access specifiers such as public, private, and protected.<br>

So far, we have used the public keyword in order to inherit a class from a previously-existing base class. However, we can also use the private and protected keywords to inherit classes. <br>
For example,<br>

<b>class Animal {<br>
    // code<br>
};<br>

class Dog : private Animal {<br>
    // code<br>
};<br>
class Cat : protected Animal {<br>
    // code<br>
};<br></b>
The various ways we can derive classes are known as access modes. These access modes have the following effect:<br>

<li>public: If a derived class is declared in public mode, then the members of the base class are inherited by the derived class just as they are.<br>
<li>private: In this case, all the members of the base class become private members in the derived class.<br>
<li>protected: The public members of the base class become protected members in the derived class.<br>
The private members of the base class are always private in the derived class.<br>
