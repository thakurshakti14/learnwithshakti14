<h3>C++ Operators</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about the different types of operators in C++ with the help of examples. In programming, an operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable.<br>

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. For example, + is an operator used for addition, while - is an operator used for subtraction.<br>

<b>Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:<br>

<li>Arithmetic Operators<br>
<li>Assignment Operators<br>
<li>Relational Operators<br>
<li>Logical Operators<br>
<li>Bitwise Operators<br>
<li>Other Operators<br></b>
<h3>1. C++ Arithmetic Operators</h3>
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data. For example,<br>

<u>a + b;</u><br>
Here, the + operator is used to add two variables a and b. Similarly there are various other arithmetic operators in C++.<br>

<li>Operator   ::	Operation<br>
<li>+	Addition<br>
<li>-	Subtraction<br>
<li>*	Multiplication<br>
<li>/	Division<br>
<li>%	Modulo Operation (Remainder after division)<br>


<h4>/ Division Operator</h4>

Note the operation (a / b) in our program. The / operator is the division operator.<br>

As we can see from the above example, if an integer is divided by another integer, we will get the quotient. However, if either divisor or dividend is a floating-point number, we will get the result in decimals.<br>

<b>In C++,<br>

7/2 is 3<br>
7.0 / 2 is 3.5<br>
7 / 2.0 is 3.5<br>
7.0 / 2.0 is 3.5<br></b>
<u>% Modulo Operator</u>

The modulo operator % computes the remainder. When a = 9 is divided by b = 4, the remainder is 1.<br>

<li>Note: The % operator can only be used with integers.<br>

<h3>Increment and Decrement Operators</h3>
C++ also provides increment and decrement operators: ++ and -- respectively.<br>

<li>++ increases the value of the operand by 1<br>
<li>-- decreases it by 1<br>
For example,<br>

<b>int num = 5;<br>

// increment operator<br>
++num;  // 6<br>
Here, the code ++num; increases the value of num by 1.<br></b>


<h3>2. C++ Assignment Operators</h3>
In C++, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. For example,<br>

// assign 5 to a<br>
<li>a = 5;<br>
Here, we have assigned a value of 5 to the variable a.<br>

<li>Operato   ::  Example  ::	Equivalent to<br>
<li>=    =	a = b;   =	a = b;<br>
<li>+=   =	a += b;  =	a = a + b;<br>
<li>-=    =	a -= b;   =	a = a - b;<br>
<li>*=   =	a *= b;    =	a = a * b;<br>
<li>/=   =	a /= b;   =	a = a / b;<br>
<li>%=   =	a %= b;  =	a = a % b;<br>

<h3>3. C++ Relational Operators</h3>
A relational operator is used to check the relationship between two operands. For example,<br>

<b>// checks if a is greater than b<br>
<li>a > b;<br>
Here, > is a relational operator. It checks if a is greater than b or not.<br>

If the relation is true, it returns 1 whereas if the relation is false, it returns 0.<br></b>

<li>Operator     ::	 Meaning	  ::    Example<br>
<li>==   =	Is Equal To    =	3 == 5 gives us false<br>
<li>!=   =	Not Equal To   =	3 != 5 gives us true<br>
<li>>   =	Greater Than   =	3 > 5 gives us false<br>
<li><   =	Less Than   =	3 < 5 gives us true<br>
<li>>=   =	Greater Than or Equal To  =	3 >= 5 give us false<br>
<li><=   =	Less Than or Equal To    =	3 <= 5 gives us true<br>


<h3>4. C++ Logical Operators</h3>
Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false. If the expression is true, it returns 1 whereas if the expression is false, it returns 0.<br>

<b>Operator	Example	Meaning<br>
&&	expression1 && expression2	Logical AND.<br>
True only if all the operands are true.<br>
||	expression1 || expression2	Logical OR.<br>
True if at least one of the operands is true.<br>
!	!expression	Logical NOT.<br>
True only if the operand is false.<br></b>
In C++, logical operators are commonly used in decision making. To further understand the logical operators, let's see the following examples,<br>

Suppose,<br>
<li>a = 5<br>
<li>b = 8<br>

Then,<br>

<li>(a > 3) && (b > 5) evaluates to true<br>
<li>(a > 3)  && (b < 5) evaluates to false<br>

<li>(a > 3) || (b > 5) evaluates to true<br>
<li>(a > 3) || (b < 5) evaluates to true<br>
<li>(a < 3) || (b < 5) evaluates to false<br>

<li>!(a < 3) evaluates to true<br>
<li>!(a > 3) evaluates to false<br>


<b>Explanation of logical operator program</b><br>

<li>(3 != 5) && (3 < 5) evaluates to 1 because both operands (3 != 5) and (3 < 5) are 1 (true).<br>
<li>(3 == 5) && (3 < 5) evaluates to 0 because the operand (3 == 5) is 0 (false).<br>
<li>(3 == 5) && (3 > 5) evaluates to 0 because both operands (3 == 5) and (3 > 5) are 0 (false).<br>
<li>(3 != 5) || (3 < 5) evaluates to 1 because both operands (3 != 5) and (3 < 5) are 1 (true).<br>
<li>(3 != 5) || (3 > 5) evaluates to 1 because the operand (3 != 5) is 1 (true).<br>
<li>(3 == 5) || (3 > 5) evaluates to 0 because both operands (3 == 5) and (3 > 5) are 0 (false).<br>
<li>!(5 == 2) evaluates to 1 because the operand (5 == 2) is 0 (false).<br>
<li>!(5 == 5) evaluates to 0 because the operand (5 == 5) is 1 (true).<br>
<h3>5. C++ Bitwise Operators</h3>
In C++, bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits. They can only be used alongside char and int data types.<br>

<li>Operator   ::	Description<br>
<li>&  =  	Binary AND<br>
<li>|  =  	Binary OR<br>
<li>^   =  	Binary XOR<br>
<li>~   =  	Binary One's Complement<br>
<li><<  =  	Binary Shift Left<br>
<li>>>   =  	Binary Shift Right<br>


<h3>6. Other C++ Operators</h3>
Here's a list of some other common operators available in C++. We will learn about them in later tutorials.<br>

<li>Operator       ::	Description     ::	Example<br>
<li>sizeof   =  returns the size of data type  = 	sizeof(int); // 4<br>
<li>?:   =  	returns value based on the condition    = 	string result = (5 > 0) ? "even" : "odd"; // "even"<br>
<li>&   =  	represents memory address of the operand     = 	&num; // address of num<br>
<li>.   =  	accesses members of struct variables or class objects  = 	s1.marks = 92;<br>
<li>->  =  	used with pointers to access the class or struct variables  = 	ptr->marks = 92;<br>
<li><<  =  	prints the output value    = 	cout << 5;<br>
<li>>>   =  	gets the input value	 =   cin >> num;<br>
