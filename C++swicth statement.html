<h3>C++ switch..case Statement</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about switch statement and its working in C++ programming with the help of some examples.<br>

The switch statement allows us to execute a block of code among many alternatives.<br>

<b>The syntax of the switch statement in C++ is:<br>

switch (expression)  {<br>
    case constant1:<br>
        // code to be executed if <br>
        // expression is equal to constant1;<br>
        break;<br>

    case constant2:<br>
        // code to be executed if<br>
        // expression is equal to constant2;<br>
        break;<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
    default:<br>
        // code to be executed if<br>
        // expression doesn't match any constant<br>
}<br></b>
How does the switch statement work?<br>

The expression is evaluated once and compared with the values of each case label.<br>

<li>If there is a match, the corresponding code after the matching label is executed. For example, if the value of the variable is equal to constant2, the code after case constant2: is executed until the break statement is encountered.<br>
<li>If there is no match, the code after default: is executed.<br>
<i>Note: We can do the same thing with the if...else..if ladder. However, the syntax of the switch statement is cleaner and much easier to read and write.<br></i>
