<h3>C++ Pointers</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about pointers in C++ and their working with the help of examples.<br>

In C++, pointers are variables that store the memory addresses of other variables.<br>

<h3>Address in C++</h3>
If we have a variable var in our program, &var will give us its address in the memory. For example,<br>
<h3>Example 1: Printing Variable Addresses in C++</h3>
<b>#include <iostream><br>
using namespace std;<br>

int main()<br>
{<br>
    // declare variables<br>
    int var1 = 3;<br>
    int var2 = 24;<br>
    int var3 = 17;<br>

    // print address of var1<br>
    cout << "Address of var1: "<< &var1 << endl;<br>

    // print address of var2<br>
    cout << "Address of var2: " << &var2 << endl;<br>

    // print address of var3<br>
    cout << "Address of var3: " << &var3 << endl;<br>
}<br>
Output<br>

<li>Address of var1: 0x7fff5fbff8ac<br>
<li>Address of var2: 0x7fff5fbff8a8<br>
<li>Address of var3: 0x7fff5fbff8a4<br></b>
<i>Note: You may not get the same results when you run the program.</i><br>
<h3>C++ Pointers</H3>
As mentioned above, pointers are used to store addresses rather than values.<br>

Here is how we can declare pointers.<br>

<li>int *pointVar;<br>
Here, we have declared a pointer pointVar of the int type.<br>

We can also declare pointers in the following way.<br>

<li>int* pointVar; // preferred syntax<br>
Let's take another example of declaring pointers.<br>

<li>int* pointVar, p;<br>
Here, we have declared a pointer pointVar and a normal variable p.<br>

<i>Note: The * operator is used after the data type to declare pointers.<br></i>
<h3>Assigning Addresses to Pointers</h3>
Here is how we can assign addresses to pointers:<br>

<b>int* pointVar, var;<br>
var = 5;<br>

// assign address of var to pointVar pointer<br>
pointVar = &var;<br></b>
Here, 5 is assigned to the variable var. And, the address of var is assigned to the pointVar pointer with the code pointVar = &var.<br>
<h3>Get the Value from the Address Using Pointers</h3>
To get the value pointed by a pointer, we use the * operator. For example:<br>

<b>int* pointVar, var;<br>
var = 5;<br>

// assign address of var to pointVar<br>
pointVar = &var;<br>

// access value pointed by pointVar<br>
cout << *pointVar << endl;   // Output: 5<br></b>
In the above code, the address of var is assigned to pointVar. We have used the *pointVar to get the value stored in that address.<br>

When * is used with pointers, it's called the dereference operator. It operates on a pointer and gives the value pointed by the address stored in the pointer. That is, *pointVar = var.<br>
<i>Note: In C++, pointVar and *pointVar is completely different. We cannot do something like *pointVar = &var;</i><br>

<b>Working of C++ pointers</b><br>
<h3>Changing Value Pointed by Pointers</h3>
If pointVar points to the address of var, we can change the value of var by using *pointVar.<br>

For example,<br>

<b>int var = 5;<br>
int* pointVar;<br>

// assign address of var<br>
pointVar = &var;<br>

// change value at address pointVar<br>
*pointVar = 1;<br>

cout << var << endl; // Output: 1<br></b>
Here, pointVar and &var have the same address, the value of var will also be changed when *pointVar is changed.<br>
<h3>Common mistakes when working with pointers</h3>
Suppose, we want a pointer varPoint to point to the address of var. Then,<br>

<b>int var, *varPoint;<br>

// Wrong! <br>
// varPoint is an address but var is not<br>
varPoint = var;<br>

// Wrong!<br>
// &var is an address<br>
// *varPoint is the value stored in &var<br>
*varPoint = &var;<br>

// Correct! <br>
// varPoint is an address and so is &var<br>
varPoint = &var;<br>

 // Correct!<br>
// both *varPoint and var are values<br>
*varPoint = var;<br></b>
