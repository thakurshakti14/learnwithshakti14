<h3>C++ Strings</h3>
In this tutorial, you'll learn to handle strings in C++. You'll learn to declare them, initialize them and use them for various input/output operations.<br>

String is a collection of characters. There are two types of strings commonly used in C++ programming language:<br>

Strings that are objects of string class (The Standard C++ Library string class)<br>
<li>C-strings (C-style Strings)<br>
<li>C-strings<br>
In C programming, the collection of characters is stored in the form of arrays. This is also supported in C++ programming. Hence it's called C-strings.<br>

C-strings are arrays of type char terminated with null character, that is, \0 (ASCII value of null character is 0).<br>

<u>How to define a C-string?</u><br>
<b>char str[] = "C++";<br></b>
In the above code, str is a string and it holds 4 characters.<br>

Although, "C++" has 3 character, the null character \0 is added to the end of the string automatically.<br>

Alternative ways of defining a string<br>
<li>char str[4] = "C++";<br>
     
<li>char str[] = {'C','+','+','\0'};<br>

<li>char str[4] = {'C','+','+','\0'};<br>
Like arrays, it is not necessary to use all the space allocated for the string. For example:<br>

<li>char str[100] = "C++";<br>
<h3>Example 1: C++ String to read a word</h3>
C++ program to display a string entered by user.<br>

<b>#include <iostream><br>
using namespace std;<br>

int main()<br>
{<br>
    char str[100];<br>

    cout << "Enter a string: ";<br>
    cin >> str;<br>
    cout << "You entered: " << str << endl;<br>

    cout << "\nEnter another string: ";<br>
    cin >> str;<br>
    cout << "You entered: "<<str<<endl;<br>

    return 0;<br>
}<br>
Output<br>

<li>Enter a string: C++<br>
<li>You entered: C++<br>

<li>Enter another string: Programming is fun.<br>
<li>You entered: Programming<br>
<i>Notice that, in the second example only "Programming" is displayed instead of "Programming is fun".<br>

This is because the extraction operator >> works as scanf() in C and considers a space " " has a terminating character.<br></i></b>
<h3>string Object</h3>
In C++, you can also create a string object for holding strings.<br>

Unlike using char arrays, string objects has no fixed length, and can be extended as per your requirement.<br>
<h3>Example 3: C++ string using string data type</h3>
<b>#include <iostream><br>
using namespace std;<br>

int main()<br>
{<br>
    // Declaring a string object<br>
    string str;<br>
    cout << "Enter a string: ";<br>
    getline(cin, str);<br>

    cout << "You entered: " << str << endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
}<br>
Output<br>

<li>Enter a string: Programming is fun.<br>
<li>You entered: Programming is fun.<br></b>
