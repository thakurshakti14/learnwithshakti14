<h3>C++ Classes and Objects</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about objects and classes and how to use them in C++ with the help of examples.<br>

In previous tutorials, we learned about functions and variables. Sometimes it's desirable to put related functions and data in one place so that it's logical and easier to work with.<br>

Suppose, we need to store the length, breadth, and height of a rectangular room and calculate its area and volume.<br>

To handle this task, we can create three variables, say, length, breadth, and height along with the functions calculateArea() and calculateVolume().<br>

However, in C++, rather than creating separate variables and functions, we can also wrap these related data and functions in a single place (by creating objects). This programming <br>
paradigm is  known as object-oriented programming.<br>

But before we can create objects and use them in C++, we first need to learn about classes.<br>
