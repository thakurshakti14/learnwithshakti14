<h3>C++ Operator Overloading</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about operator overloading with the help of examples.<br>

In C++, we can change the way operators work for user-defined types like objects and structures. This is known as operator overloading. For example,<br>

Suppose we have created three objects c1, c2 and result from a class named Complex that represents complex numbers.<br>

Since operator overloading allows us to change how operators work, we can redefine how the + operator works and use it to add the complex numbers of c1 and c2 by writing the <br>
following code:<br>

<li>result = c1 + c2;<br>
instead of something like<br>

<li>result = c1.addNumbers(c2);<br>
This makes our code intuitive and easy to understand.<br>

<i>Note: We cannot use operator overloading for fundamental data types like int, float, char and so on.<br></i>
<h3>Syntax for C++ Operator Overloading</h3>
To overload an operator, we use a special operator function. We define the function inside the class or structure whose objects/variables we want the overloaded operator to work with.<br>

class className {<br>
    ... .. ...<br>
    public<br>
       returnType operator symbol (arguments) {<br>
           ... .. ...<br>
       } <br>
    ... .. ...<br>
};<br>
Here,<br>

<li>returnType is the return type of the function.
<li>operator is a keyword.
<li>symbol is the operator we want to overload. Like: +, <, -, ++, etc.
<li>arguments is the arguments passed to the function.
<h3>Operator Overloading in Unary Operators</h3>
Unary operators operate on only one operand. The increment operator ++ and decrement operator -- are examples of unary operators.<br>
<h3>Operator Overloading in Binary Operators</h3>
Binary operators work on two operands. For example,<br>

<li>result = num + 9;<br>
Here, + is a binary operator that works on the operands num and 9.<br>

When we overload the binary operator for user-defined types by using the code:<br>

<li>obj3 = obj1 + obj2;<br>
The operator function is called using the obj1 object and obj2 is passed as an argument to the function.<br>

<h3>Things to Remember in C++ Operator Overloading</h3>
Two operators = and & are already overloaded by default in C++. For example, to copy objects of the same class, we can directly use the = operator. We do not need to create an operator function.<br>
Operator overloading cannot change the precedence and associativity of operators. However, if we want to change the order of evaluation, parentheses should be used.<br>
There are 4 operators that cannot be overloaded in C++. They are:<br>
<li>:: (scope resolution)<br>
<li>. (member selection)<br>
<li>.* (member selection through pointer to function)<br>
<li>?: (ternary operator)<br>
