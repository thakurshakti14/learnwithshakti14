<h3>C++ Pointers and Arrays</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about the relation between arrays and pointers with the help of examples.<br>

In C++, Pointers are variables that hold addresses of other variables. Not only can a pointer store the address of a single variable, it can also store the address of cells of an array.<br>

Consider this example:<br>

<b>int *ptr;<br>
int arr[5];<br>

// store the address of the first<br>
// element of arr in ptr<br>
ptr = arr;<br></b>
Here, ptr is a pointer variable while arr is an int array. The code ptr = arr; stores the address of the first element of the array in variable ptr.<br>

<i>Notice that we have used arr instead of &arr[0]. This is because both are the same. So, the code below is the same as the code above.</i><br>

<b>int *ptr;<br>
int arr[5];<br>
ptr = &arr[0];<br>
The addresses for the rest of the array elements are given by &arr[1], &arr[2], &arr[3], and &arr[4].</b><br>
<h3>Point to Every Array Elements</h3>
Suppose we need to point to the fourth element of the array using the same pointer ptr.<br>

Here, if ptr points to the first element in the above example then ptr + 3 will point to the fourth element. For example,<br>

<b>int *ptr;<br>
int arr[5];<br>
ptr = arr;<br>

ptr + 1 is equivalent to &arr[1];<br>
ptr + 2 is equivalent to &arr[2];<br>
ptr + 3 is equivalent to &arr[3];<br>
ptr + 4 is equivalent to &arr[4];<br></b>
Similarly, we can access the elements using the single pointer. For example,<br>

// use dereference operator<br>
<b>*ptr == arr[0];<br>
*(ptr + 1) is equivalent to arr[1];<br>
*(ptr + 2) is equivalent to arr[2];<br>
*(ptr + 3) is equivalent to arr[3];<br>
*(ptr + 4) is equivalent to arr[4];<br>
Suppose if we have initialized ptr = &arr[2]; then<br>

ptr - 2 is equivalent to &arr[0];<br>
ptr - 1 is equivalent to &arr[1]; <br>
ptr + 1 is equivalent to &arr[3];<br>
ptr + 2 is equivalent to &arr[4];<br></b>

<i>Note: The address between ptr and ptr + 1 differs by 4 bytes. It is because ptr is a pointer to an int data. And, the size of int is 4 bytes in a 64-bit operating system.</i><br>

Similarly, if pointer ptr is pointing to char type data, then the address between ptr and ptr + 1 is 1 byte. It is because the size of a character is 1 byte.<br>
