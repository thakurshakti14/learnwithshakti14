<h3>C++ while and do...while Loop</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn the use of while and do...while loops in C++ programming .<br>

In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.<br>

For example, let's say we want to show a message 100 times. Then instead of writing the print statement 100 times, we can use a loop.<br>

That was just a simple example; we can achieve much more efficiency and sophistication in our programs by making effective use of loops.<br>

<b>There are 3 types of loops in C++.<br>

<li>for loop<br>
<li>while loop<br>
<li>do...while loop<br>
In the previous tutorial, we learned about the C++ for loop. Here, we are going to learn about while and do...while loops.<br>

<h3>C++ while Loop</h3>
<b>The syntax of the while loop is:<br>

while (condition) {<br>
    // body of the loop<br>
}<br></b>
Here,<br>

A while loop evaluates the condition<br>
If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the while loop is executed.<br>
The condition is evaluated again.<br>
This process continues until the condition is false.<br>
When the condition evaluates to false, the loop terminates.<br>

<h3>C++ do...while Loop</h3>

The do...while loop is a variant of the while loop with one important difference: the body of do...while loop is executed once before the condition is checked.<br>

<b>Its syntax is:<br>

do {<br>
   // body of loop;<br>
}<br>
while (condition);<br></b>
Here,<br>

The body of the loop is executed at first. Then the condition is evaluated.<br>
If the condition evaluates to true, the body of the loop inside the do statement is executed again.<br>
The condition is evaluated once again.<br>
If the condition evaluates to true, the body of the loop inside the do statement is executed again.<br>

<h3>Infinite while loop</h3>
If the condition of a loop is always true, the loop runs for infinite times (until the memory is full). For example,<br>

<b>// infinite while loop<br>
while(true) {<br>
    // body of the loop<br>
}<br></b>
Here is an example of an infinite do...while loop.<br>
<b>// infinite do...while loop<br>

int count = 1;<br>

do {<br>
   // body of loop<br>
} <br>
while(count == 1);<br></b>
In the above programs, the condition is always true. Hence, the loop body will run for infinite times.<br>


<h3>for vs while loops</h3>
A for loop is usually used when the number of iterations is known. For example,<br>

<b>// This loop is iterated 5 times<br>
for (int i = 1; i <=5; ++i) {<br>
   // body of the loop<br>
}<br></b>
Here, we know that the for-loop will be executed 5 times.

<li>However, while and do...while loops are usually used when the number of iterations is unknown. For example,<br>

<b>while (condition) {<br>
    // body of the loop<br>
}</b>
