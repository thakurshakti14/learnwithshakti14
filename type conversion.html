<h3>C++ Type Conversion</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn about the basics of C++ type conversion with the help of examples.<br>

<b>C++ allows us to convert data of one type to that of another. This is known as type conversion.<br>

There are two types of type conversion in C++.</b><br>

<u>Implicit Conversion<br>
Explicit Conversion (also known as Type Casting)</u><br>
<h3>mplicit Type Conversion</h3>
The type conversion that is done automatically done by the compiler is known as implicit type conversion. This type of conversion is also known as automatic conversion.<br>

<b>Let us look at two examples of implicit type conversion.</b><br>

<li>Example 1: Conversion From int to double<br>
<b>// Working of implicit type-conversion<br>

#include <iostream><br>
using namespace std;<br>

int main() {<br>
   // assigning an int value to num_int<br>
   int num_int = 9;<br>

   // declaring a double type variable<br>
   double num_double;<br>
 
   // implicit conversion<br>
   // assigning int value to a double variable<br>
   num_double = num_int;<br>

   cout << "num_int = " << num_int << endl;<br>
   cout << "num_double = " << num_double << endl;<br>

   return 0;<br>
}<br>
Output<br>

num_int = 9<br>
num_double = 9<br></b>
<li>In the program, we have assigned an int data to a double variable.<br>

<u>num_double = num_int;<br></u>
Here, the int value is automatically converted to double by the compiler before it is assigned to the num_double variable. This is an example of implicit type conversion.<br>

<li>Example 2: Automatic Conversion from double to int<br>
<b>//Working of Implicit type-conversion<br>

#include <iostream><br>
using namespace std;<br>

int main() {<br>

   int num_int;<br>
   double num_double = 9.99;<br>

   // implicit conversion<br>
   // assigning a double value to an int variable<br>
   num_int = num_double;<br>

   cout << "num_int = " << num_int << endl;<br>
   cout << "num_double = " << num_double << endl;<br>

   return 0;<br>
}<br>
Output<br>

num_int = 9<br>
num_double = 9.99<br></b>
<li>In the program, we have assigned a double data to an int variable.<br>

<u>num_double = num_int;<br></u>
Here, the double value is automatically converted to int by the compiler before it is assigned to the num_int variable. This is also an example of implicit type conversion.<br>

<i>Note: Since int cannot have a decimal part, the digits after the decimal point are truncated in the above example.<br></i>

<h3>Data Loss During Conversion (Narrowing Conversion)</h3>
As we have seen from the above example, conversion from one data type to another is prone to data loss. This happens when data of a larger type is converted to data of a smaller type.<br>

Data loss in C++ if a larger type of data is converted to a smaller type.<br>

<h3>C++ Explicit Conversion</h3>
When the user manually changes data from one type to another, this is known as explicit conversion. This type of conversion is also known as type casting.<br>

<b>There are three major ways in which we can use explicit conversion in C++. They are:</b><br>

<li>C-style type casting (also known as cast notation)<br>
<li>Function notation (also known as old C++ style type casting)<br>
<li>Type conversion operators<br>
<h3>C-style Type Casting</h3>

As the name suggests, this type of casting is favored by the C programming language. It is also known as cast notation.<br>

The syntax for this style is:<br>

(data_type)expression;<br>
For example,<br>

<b>// initializing int variable<br>
int num_int = 26;<br>

// declaring double variable<br>
double num_double;<br>

// converting from int to double<br><br>
num_double = (double)num_int;<br></b>
<h3>Function-style Casting</h3>
We can also use the function like notation to cast data from one type to another.<br>

The syntax for this style is:<br>

data_type(expression);<br>
For example,<br>

<b>// initializing int variable<br>
int num_int = 26;<br>

// declaring double variable<br>
double num_double;<br>

// converting from int to double<br>
num_double = double(num_int);<br></b>
<h3>Example 3: Type Casting</h3>
<b>#include <iostream><br>

using namespace std;<br>

int main() {<br>
    // initializing a double variable<br>
    double num_double = 3.56;<br>
    cout << "num_double = " << num_double << endl;<br>

    // C-style conversion from double to int<br>
    int num_int1 = (int)num_double;<br>
    cout << "num_int1   = " << num_int1 << endl;<br>

    // function-style conversion from double to int<br>
    int num_int2 = int(num_double);<br>
    cout << "num_int2   = " << num_int2 << endl;<br>

    return 0;<br>
}<br>
Output<br>

<li>num_double = 3.56<br>
<li>num_int1   = 3<br>
<li>num_int2   = 3<br></b>
We used both the <u>C style type conversion </u>and <u>the function-style casting </u>for type conversion and displayed the results. Since they perform the same task, both give us the same output.<br>

<h3>Type Conversion Operators</h3>
<b>Besides these two type castings, C++ also has four operators for type conversion. They are known as type conversion operators. They are:<br>

<li>static_cast<br>
<li>dynamic_cast<br>
<li>const_cast<br>
<li>reinterpret_cast<br></b>
We will learn about these casts in later tutorials.
