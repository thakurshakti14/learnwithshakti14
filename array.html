<h3>C++ Arrays</h3>
In this tutorial, we will learn to work with arrays. We will learn to declare, initialize, and access array elements in C++ programming with the help of examples.<br>

In C++, an array is a variable that can store multiple values of the same type. For example,<br>

Suppose a class has 27 students, and we need to store the grades of all of them. Instead of creating 27 separate variables, we can simply create an array:<br>

<li>double grade[27];<br>
Here, grade is an array that can hold a maximum of 27 elements of double type.<br>

In C++, the size and type of arrays cannot be changed after its declaration.<br>

<b>C++ Array Declaration<br>
dataType arrayName[arraySize];<br></b>
For example,<br>

<li>int x[6];<br>
Here,<br>

<li>int - type of element to be stored<br>
<li>x - name of the array<br>
<li>6 - size of the array<br>
<h3>Access Elements in C++ Array</h3>
In C++, each element in an array is associated with a number. The number is known as an array index. We can access elements of an array by using those indices.<br>
<b>// syntax to access array elements<br>
array[index];<br></b>
Consider the array x we have seen above.<br>

<b>Few Things to Remember:</b><br>
<li>The array indices start with 0. Meaning x[0] is the first element stored at index 0.<br>
<li>If the size of an array is n, the last element is stored at index (n-1). In this example, x[5] is the last element.<br>
<li>Elements of an array have consecutive addresses. For example, suppose the starting address of x[0] is 2120d. Then, the address of the next element x[1] will be 2124d, the address of x[2] will be 2128d and so on.<br>

<b>Here, the size of each element is increased by 4. This is because the size of int is 4 bytes.</b><br>
<h3>C++ Array Initialization</h3>
In C++, it's possible to initialize an array during declaration. For example,<br>

<b>// declare and initialize and array<br>
int x[6] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9, 15};</b><br>

Another method to initialize array during declaration:<br>

<b>// declare and initialize an array<br>
int x[] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9, 15};<br></b>
Here, we have not mentioned the size of the array. In such cases, the compiler automatically computes the size.<br>
<h3>C++ Array With Empty Members</h3>
In C++, if an array has a size n, we can store upto n number of elements in the array. However, what will happen if we store less than n number of elements.<br>

For example,<br>

<b>// store only 3 elements in the array<br>
int x[6] = {19, 10, 8};<br></b>
Here, the array x has a size of 6. However, we have initialized it with only 3 elements.<br>

In such cases, the compiler assigns random values to the remaining places. Oftentimes, this random value is simply 0.<br>

Empty array members are automatically assigned the value 0<br>
<u>How to insert and print array elements?</u><br>
<b>int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9}<br>

// change 4th element to 9<br>
mark[3] = 9;<br>

// take input from the user<br>
// store the value at third position<br>
cin >> mark[2];<br>


// take input from the user<br>
// insert at ith position<br>
cin >> mark[i-1];<br>

// print first element of the array<br>
cout << mark[0];<br>

// print ith element of the array<br>
cout >> mark[i-1];<br></b>
<h3>C++ Array Out of Bounds</h3>
If we declare an array of size 10, then the array will contain elements from index 0 to 9.<br>

However, if we try to access the element at index 10 or more than 10, it will result in Undefined Behaviour.
